    "**message function** takes a single argument `edges`, which is an `EdgeBatch` instance. During message passing, DGL generates it internally to represent a batch of edges. It has three members `src`, `dst`, and `data` to access features of source nodes, destination nodes, and edges, respectively.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**reduce function** takes a single argument `nodes`, which is an `NodeBatch` instance. During message passing, DGL generates it internally to represent a batch of nodes. It has member `mailbox` to access the messages received for the nodes in the batch. Some of the most common reduce operations include `sum`, `max`, `min`, `mean`.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**update function** takes a single argument `nodes`. This function operates on the aggregation result from `reduce function`, typically combining it with a node's original feature at the last step and saving the result as a node feature.  \n",
    "\n",
    "DGL has implemented commonly used message functions and reduce functions as **built-in** in the namespace `dgl.function`. In general, DGL suggests using build-in functions **whenever possible** since they are heavily optimized and automatically handle dimension broadcasting."
